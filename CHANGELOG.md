# Changelog

All notable changes to Mouseion will be documented in this file.

## [2025-12-30] - Fresh-Start Migration

### Phase 0: Mouseion.Common Foundation

Ground-up rewrite of Mouseion based on Radarr architecture with clean `Mouseion.*` namespace.

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (40 working days)
**Goal**: Backend for media player integration

## [2025-12-30] - Code Quality Standards

### Added
- **C# Code Standards Documentation** - Comprehensive coding standards in CLAUDE.md
  - Before: No documented standards
  - After: Self-documenting code philosophy, naming conventions, efficiency patterns, AI trope blacklist
  - Rationale: Establish quality foundation before scaling development
  - Impact: All future code follows documented patterns

---

## [2025-12-30] - Platform Guards

### Fixed
- **ServiceProvider Platform Guards** - Added runtime OS checks for Windows-specific APIs
  - Before: 86 CA1416 warnings for Windows-only ServiceController usage
  - After: 0 new warnings, graceful cross-platform degradation
  - Implementation: `OsInfo.IsWindows` guards + `#pragma warning disable CA1416`
  - Gotcha: Analyzer can't detect runtime guards, pragma still needed after guard
  - Alternative: Could suppress globally, but runtime guards provide better UX

## Future Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Backend (Weeks 1-4)
- Media streaming API (HTTP 206 range requests)
- Progress tracking for audiobooks/podcasts
- Podcast foundation (PodcastShows, PodcastEpisodes)
- Unified search endpoint
- High-resolution audio metadata
- OpenAPI spec generation

### Phase 2: Akroasis Integration (Weeks 5-8)
- Delta sync endpoint (`modifiedSince`)
- File hash in responses
- Cover art dynamic resizing
- Chapter marker parsing (M4B/MP3)
- Listening history tracking
- Bulk operations

### Client Integration
- **Integration Point**: Week 3 (streaming endpoint ready)
- **Chapter Markers**: Week 4 (HIGH priority for audiobook UX)
- **Full Integration**: Week 8 (all features complete)

## Technical Debt

**Current**: 51 warnings (pre-existing from PRs #1-4)
- 46× CS86xx (nullability)
- 4× CA1416 (platform guards needed in RuntimeInfo.cs)
- 1× CS0618 (DryIoc obsolete API usage)

**Strategy**: Fix as we touch files, don't block progress
